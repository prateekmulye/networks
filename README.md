# Synthetic Network Testing Microservice

A Spring Bootâ€“based microservice that lets you define, schedule, and execute synthetic HTTP and ICMP tests, stream results to Kafka, persist them in PostgreSQL, and run containerized via Docker/Kubernetes. Ideal for showcasing Java, Kafka, Docker, and cloud-native skills.

## Overview

This microservice allows you to:

- **Create & manage** synthetic test configurations (HTTP or ICMP).  
- **Schedule** periodic execution of these tests.  
- **Stream** each test result to Kafka for real-time processing.  
- **Persist** historical results in PostgreSQL for analysis.  
- **Expose** REST APIs for configuration and (optionally) result retrieval.  
- **Containerize** the entire stack with Docker and Kubernetes manifests.

---

## Features

- **REST API** for CRUD operations on test configurations  
- **Spring Scheduling** to trigger tests at configurable intervals  
- **HTTP & ICMP** measurement implementations  
- **Apache Kafka** producer & consumer integration  
- **Spring Data JPA** + **PostgreSQL** for storage  
- **Spring Boot Actuator** for health checks & metrics  
- **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml** for local orchestration  
- **Kubernetes** manifests for cloud-native deployment

- <img alt="pending" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pending-yellow?style=flat-square"> **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**  
  Use machine learning to detect unusual latency, packet loss, or outage patterns in test results, and proactively surface incidents.

- <img alt="pending" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pending-yellow?style=flat-square"> **Predictive Analytics**  
  Leverage AI to forecast potential network degradations based on historical data and trends.

- <img alt="pending" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pending-yellow?style=flat-square"> **Natural Language Interface**  
  Allow users to configure and query tests using natural language (e.g., via a chatbot or voice assistant).

- <img alt="pending" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pending-yellow?style=flat-square"> **Integration with Observability Platforms**  
  Export metrics to Prometheus, Grafana, or OpenTelemetry for unified monitoring.
